    Moirai is a font that experiments with stroke movement with visibility and legibility. It is designed to draw, arrange, and delete strokes of letters to have the minimum strokes and slopes necessary for that letter to be recognized. The shapes surrounding the thick space with thin, round lines give a lovely impression, while also creating a light and lyrical atmosphere.

    JAMO is a type design collective group based in Seoul, Korea. We provide professional education, information, and discussion to designers who are wishing to develop their own typefaces through our workshop. JAMO encourages more experimental and unconventional typeface design by getting inspirations from old types, finding an alternative usage from existing ones, and suggesting new letterforms for the future. We aim to escape from the passive practice and create more self-initiating active typefaces. JAMO offers high-quality typeface design based on the deep levels of research, planning, and study. By broadening the potential of Hangul, we propose a new type design methodology to co-live with other worldwide letters including the Latin Alphabet.
